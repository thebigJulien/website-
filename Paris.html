        <p>Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital and most populous city of
            France, with an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles) and an official estimated population of
            2,140,526 residents as of 1 January 2019.[1] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major
            centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts. The City of Paris is the centre and
            seat of government of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2019 population of
            12,213,364, or about 18 percent of the population of France.[1] The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion
            ($808 billion) in 2017.[3] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in
            2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, Hong
            Kong, Oslo and Geneva.[4] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong
            Kong, in 2018.[5]

            The city is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports:
            Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe) and Paris-Orly.[6][7] Opened in 1900, the
            city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily,[8] and is the second busiest
            metro system in Europe after Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway station in the world,
            but the first located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[9]

            Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art
            museum in the world in 2018, with 10.2 million visitors.[10][11] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet,
            and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art, the Pompidou Centre
            Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe, and the
            Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit the works of the two noted Parisians. The historical district along
            the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site, and popular landmarks in the city
            centre include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris and the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, both on
            the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand
            Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the
            Champs-Élysées, and the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur on the hill of Montmartre.

            Paris received 24.5 million visitors in 2018, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign
            visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and China.[12] It was ranked as the
            second most visited travel destination in the world in 2018, after Bangkok.[13]
